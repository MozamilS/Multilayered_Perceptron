# Multilayered_Perceptron

This is a neural network project where a fully functioning neural network or multilayered perceptron was developed from scratch following conventional neural network theory. The neural network was built in an attempt to predict the stock market; while the model did not perform well in predicting stock market fluctuations, the neural network was tested and found to be trainable and performed well in the test runs.
